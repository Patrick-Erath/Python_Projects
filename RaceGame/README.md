## Race Game
A 2D race game which was implemented using the pygame library. 
The game allows the user to control a small race car to avoid obstacles falling horizontally.
As such, the user uses the left and right key buttons to move left or right and avoid obstacles.
The game gets progressively harder as the obstacles fall at a faster pace and become wider
